well, lena is hired at the tickle me elmo factory and she reports for her first day promptly at 8:00 am.

the next day at 8:45 am there is a knock at the personnel manager's door.

the foreman throws open the door and begins to rant about the new employee.

he complains that she is incredibly slow and the whole line is backing up, putting the entire production line behind schedule.

the personnel manager decides he should see this for himself, so the 2 men march down to the factory floor.

when they get there the line is so backed up that there are tickle me elmo's all over the factory floor and they're really beginning to pile up.

at the end of the line stands lena surrounded by mountains of tickle me elmo's.

she has a roll of plush red fabric and a huge bag of small marbles.

the 2 men watch in amazement as she cuts a little piece of fabric, wraps it around two marbles and begins to carefully sew the little package between elmo's legs.

the personnel manager bursts into laughter.

after several minutes of hysterics he pulls himself together and approaches lena .

“i'm sorry,” he says to her, barely able to keep a straight face, “but i think you misunderstood the instructions i gave you yesterday...”

i went to breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant and say, ""happy
birthday"",
as it turned out, she didn't even say good morning, let alone any ""happy
birthday"". i thought, well, that's wives for you, the children will
remember. the children came in to breakfast and didn't say a word.
so when i left for the office, i was feeling pretty low and despondent..

as i walked into my office, my secretary janet said, ""good morning, boss,
""happy birthday"". and i felt a little better that someone had remembered.
i worked until noon, then janet knocked on my door and said ""you know,
it's
such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go to lunch,
just you and me."" i said, ""by george, that's the greatest thing i've heard
all day. let's go!"" we went to lunch.
we didn't go where we normally go; instead we went out to a private little
place. we had two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously.
on the way back to the office, she said, ""you know, it's such a beautiful
day. we don't need to go back to the office, do we?""
i said, ""no, i guess
not.""
she said, ""let's go to my apartment.""

after arriving at her apartment she said, ""boss, if you don't mind, i
think
i'll go into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable""
""sure!"" i excitedly replied.
she went into the bedroom and, in about six minutes, she came out carrying

it was tragic, but jim and tom managed to get through it. after a while, jim and tom's resistance to nature's urgings waned, and the inevitable happened. well, a couple more years went by and jim and tom began to feel absolutely horrible about what they were doing.

on the way to the office he regretted what he had done, realizing that the whole event had not been worth the price so he had his secretary send a check for $250 and enclose the following typed note:

“dear madam:

enclosed find check in the amount of $250 for rent of your apartment. i am not sending the amount agreed upon, because when i rented the place, i was under the impression that:

#1 – it had never been occupied;
#2 – there was plenty of heat; and
#3 – it was small enough to make me feel cozy and at home.

however, i found out that it had been previously occupied, that there wasn’t any heat, and that it was entirely too large.”

upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately returned the check for $250 with the following note :

“dear sir:

first of all, i cannot understand how you could expect a beautiful apartment to remain unoccupied indefinitely. as for the heat, there is plenty of it, if you know how to turn it on. regarding the space, the apartment is indeed of regular size, but if you don’t have enough furniture to fill it, please do not blame the management.

please send the rent in full or we will be forced to contact your present landlady.”

it seems that annie was born with a rather unusually large vagina and therefore has been unable to sustain any sort of long term relationships because even the most well endowed men soon lose interest because of her inability to satisfy them sexually.

so when a guy from the office whom she really likes asked her out, she decided to take desperate measures. on the way home she stops at the butcher and buys a pound of fresh liver. she gets ready for her big date and slides that pound of liver into her box hoping that it will take up some of the slack, just in case the evening should turn out to be romantic.

bill picks her up, they go out, dinner, dancing, cocktails, have the best time, and sure enough, end up back at her place, have some great sex and fall asleep in each others arms.

annie wakes up the next morning and bill is nowhere to be seen. she sighs and thinks, ""oh well, i gave it my best shot, i guess i'm doomed to end up an old maid.""

she goes downstairs to make coffee and finds a note on the kitchen table.....

""dear annie, thank you so much for last night! i had a really great time, and i think you are wonderful !

sorry i had to leave so early, but i'll call you later and i hope we can get together again real soon !

i honestly answered, 'no, this is my first time.' so she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. she cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. 

i apparently still looked confused. so, she looked all around the store to see if it were empty. it was empty. 'just a minute,' she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. she unhooked her bra and laid it aside. 'do these excite you?' she asked. well, i was so dumb-struck that all i could do was nod my head. she then said it was time to slip the condom on. as i was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk. 'well, come on', she said, 'we don't have much time.' so i climbed on her. it was so wonderful, that unfortunately, i could no longer hold back and kapow, i was done within a few moments.

cxuzt,Beware of young bull elephants for they may not know what they do.,"in 1986, peter davies was on holiday in kenya after graduating from northwestern university .
on a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air.

the elephant seemed distressed, so peter approached it very carefully.
he got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it.
as carefully and as gently as he could, peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.
the elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled.
eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away.
peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.


twenty years later, peter was walking through the chicago zoo with his teenaged son.
as they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and
walked over to near where peter and his son cameron were standing.

the large bull elephant stared at peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down.
the elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.
remembering the encounter in 1986, peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant.

peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure. he walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. the elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.
